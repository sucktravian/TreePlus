## üí° Why TreePlus?
PowerShell‚Äôs built-in tree command is dated and lacks modern features. TreePlus was built to provide a cleaner, richer, and more customizable tree-view experience. Here's what sets TreePlus apart:

Feature	TreePlus ‚úÖ	Legacy Tree ‚ùå
Emoji support (üìÅ üìÑ)	Yes	No
Markdown export	Yes	No
Clipboard integration	Yes	No
Color-coded extensions	Yes	No
File size display	Yes	No
Hidden item handling	Yes	No
Exclude folders	Yes	No
Extension filters	Yes	No

>üí¨ Note: Emoji support requires PowerShell 7+ and a compatible font. PowerShell 5.x typically does not render emojis properly in the terminal.

## üöÄ Installation

Install from the PowerShell Gallery:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name TreePlus
```

## Usage examples
```powershell
# Basic Tree of folders Only
Show-Tree -Path "C:\Projects"

# Include file and file sizes
Show-Tree -Path "C:\Projects" -ShowFiles -ShowFileSizes

# Limit tree depth
Show-Tree -Path "C:\Projects" -Depth 2

# Filter by Extension
Show-Tree -Path "C:\Scripts" -ShowFiles -IncludeExtensions ".ps1", ".psm1"

# Exclude Folders
Show-Tree -Path "." -ExcludeFolders ".git", "node_modules"

# Output to MarkDown for README etc
Show-Tree -Path "." -ShowFiles -MarkdownOutput -OutputFile "tree.md"

# Copy Tree to Clipboard
Show-Tree -Path "." -ShowFiles -ToClipboard

```

## Tests
```powershell
Invoke-Pester -Path .\tests
```

## Emoji Support

Emojis (üìÅ, üìÑ) are only shown if:

-PlainAscii is not used

-MarkdownOutput is not used

PowerShell 7+ (with UTF-8 support) is required for emoji output to display correctly in most terminals

In Windows PowerShell 5.1, emojis may not render correctly or at all

Use -PlainAscii to disable emojis if needed:
```powershell
Show-Tree -Path "." -PlainAscii
```
